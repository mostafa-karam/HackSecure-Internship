# HackSecure Internship Projects (2025)

This repository contains the complete deliverables for my Cybersecurity Internship under **Hack Secure** as part of the **Red Teaming 2025 Batch**.

---

## 🔐 Projects Overview

### 1. Password Strength Checker (GUI)
- Evaluates password security level.
- Checks for length, uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.
- Built using `tkinter` with a modern UI.

### 2. Port Scanner (GUI)
- Scans a target IP/domain across a range of ports.
- Displays open ports in a responsive, styled interface.
- Uses `socket`, `threading`, and `tkinter`.

### 3. File Encryption/Decryption Tool (GUI)
- Encrypts and decrypts `.txt` files using Fernet (AES-based).
- Allows key generation and file selection.
- GUI styled with `ttk` and integrated dialogs.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python 3
- tkinter & ttk (GUI)
- socket (Port Scanning)
- cryptography.fernet (Encryption)
- threading (Multithreading for scans)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone this repo:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/HackSecure-Internship.git
cd HackSecure-Internship
```

2. **Install dependencies (only for encryption tool):**
```bash
pip install cryptography
```

3. **Run each script:**
```bash
python password_strength_checker/password_strength_gui.py
python port_scanner/port_scanner_gui.py
python file_encryption_tool/file_encryption_gui.py
```

---

## 📸 Screenshots
Include screenshots in the `/screenshots/` folder for each project:
- Password Checker UI examples
- Port Scanner with open ports
- File Encryption before/after

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
- Practical exposure to red teaming and ethical hacking
- Developed clean and functional Python GUIs
- Integrated error handling and real-time feedback

---

## 📄 Final Report
See `final_report.pdf` or `Internship Final Report.md` for full documentation.

---

## 🙏 Acknowledgment
Thanks to **Hack Secure**, my mentors **Mr. Aman Pandey** and **Mr. Prabhat Raj**, and the entire team for the opportunity and support during this internship.
