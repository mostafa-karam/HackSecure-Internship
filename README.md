# HackSecure Internship Projects (2025)

This repository contains the complete deliverables for my Cybersecurity Internship under **Hack Secure** as part of the **Red Teaming 2025 Batch**.

---

## 🔐 Projects Overview

### 1. Password Strength Checker (GUI)
- Evaluates password security level.
- Checks for length, uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.
- Built using `tkinter` with a modern UI.

### 2. Port Scanner (GUI)
- Scans a target IP/domain across a range of ports.
- Displays open ports in a responsive, styled interface.
- Uses `socket`, `threading`, and `tkinter`.

### 3. File Encryption/Decryption Tool (GUI)
- Encrypts and decrypts `.txt` files using Fernet (AES-based).
- Allows key generation and file selection.
- GUI styled with `ttk` and integrated dialogs.
